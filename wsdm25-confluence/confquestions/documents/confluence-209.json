I can't remember the details of our discussions about that part. Also I thought there was another up front section that Rich had done that is missing. Maybe I am confused.</span><br/></span></p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Project Platform</span></h2><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Platform Properties</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The list of important properties of the OpenXT Project Platform that are subject to governance supervision is maintained in a separate document: <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"Gov2: OpenXT Platform Properties [ DRAFT ] [ xtopher-v2 ]\" ri:space-key=\"~cclark\"></ri:page><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[OpenXT Platform Properties]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link>.</span><br/></span></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\">Layers</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The OpenXT Project software utilizes the composable software layers provided by OpenEmbedded in order to isolate customizations, such as hardware, GUI environments and distributions. The OpenXT layers create modular governance contexts for specific use cases, target markets and operational models, with a narrowed set of stakeholders and increased prospects of stakeholder alignment within individual layers.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The OpenXT Project applies the layering mechanism to support the coexistence of multiple use cases within a common codebase. This enables maximization of collaboration on common components while also enabling non-aligned stakeholder requirements to be satisfied in different layers.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Base Platform Layer:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">OpenXT Core Platform</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Proposed Optional Layers:<br/></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Switching display and input (surfman) layer <span style=\"color: rgb(51,102,255);\">&lt;&lt;To do: Link to the RFC for this layer here when ready&gt;&gt;</span><br/></span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Compositing display and input (Qt) layer</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"> <span style=\"color: rgb(51,102,255);\">&lt;&lt;To do: Link to the RFC for this layer here when ready&gt;&gt;</span></span><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51,102,255);\"> </span></span><br/><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51,102,255);\"> </span></span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51,102,255);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">&lt;&lt; AIS are working on a document describing layers. &gt;&gt;</span></span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP have emailed persons involved to get status on this</span></p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\">Project Meetings</span></h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\">The OpenXT Project shall hold monthly telephone Community Conference Call meetings on the third Thursday of every month at 4pm UTC. If the date of the call falls upon a legal holiday then an alternative date, not more than two weeks distant from the intended calculated date, may be appointed instead by the Governance Board.<br/></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\">The Community Conference Call is public and open to all members of the OpenXT community.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP I guess we still have not really defined what a community member is. There was some discussion on this in another email thread (spi reference material).</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\">Notification of the Community Conference Call shall be sent by a member of the Governance Board to the mailing list at a time between one week and one day prior to the call. The Notification shall include the timing of the call and the telephone access information for the call.<br/></span></p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\">Project Governance Board</span></h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The OpenXT Project shall have a Governance Board of seven appointed individuals.<br/></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">This body shall represent the interests of parties involved in the OpenXT Project as well as the interests of the OpenXT platform itself.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The Board is responsible for:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"> Ensuring that decision making is effective within the project<br/></span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Acting as the decision maker of last resort</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Setting the project charter<br/></span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Driving project activities in pursuit of project goals derived from the charter</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">This body will form a decision making authority to resolve issues that impact OpenXT and arrive at decisions on behalf of the whole community that cannot be easily resolved by the Pull Request process.</span></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Scope of Mandate</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The Board may issue a binding resolution on any decision which affects the OpenXT software platform, shared resources or development practices, where lazy consensus is not achievable via community dialogue, the mailing list RFC process and monthly community call. Board members are expected to fairly interpret this document and to objectively apply the documented principles for the benefit of the OpenXT project and all contributors. <br/></span></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Board Formation<br/></span></span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">An initial body of a seven individuals will be formed by community agreement. </span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Board members are appointed as individuals, not as representatives of their employers; companies do not own seats. Individuals are appointed for their expertise.</span></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Changes to the Board</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51,102,255);\">&lt;&lt;This subsection needs to be reviewed.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">A Board member will be required to step down from their position in any of the following circumstances:</span></p><ul><li>The Board member expresses a request to the Governance Board to retire from the position, where this request is issued by cryptographically signed email to the Project mailing list.</li><li>The Board member is absent from Governance Board decision making for a period of two months where at least three decisions have been required of the Board in that period. <span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP I think there should be provisions for extenuating circumstances here, e.g. someone is in an accident, has a serious personal problem and is on sabbatical. Perhaps we can have a provision for a stand in/temporary board member for things like this?</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The remainder of the Board unanimously agrees that sufficient cause exists for removal, acting in the best interests of the Project.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Vacancies on the Board shall be filled by a public vote of the majority of the remaining members of the Board. The vote shall be held within two weeks of the vacancy occurring. <span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP so what happens if the vote cannot be done in two weeks - does the project just end?  <ac:emoticon ac:name=\"smile\"></ac:emoticon> </span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The Board shall endeavour to ensure that sufficient technical expertise and capacity for sound judgement is present among the constituent members of the Board to enable efficient and effective decision making in the best interests of the Project as guided by the Project Purpose.<br/></span></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Responsibilities of the Board Members</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51,102,255);\">&lt;&lt;This subsection needs to be reviewed.&gt;&gt;</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The members of the Governance Board are required to:</span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Provide guidance and direction to project contributors on how to address challenges presented by proposed changes in order to seek solutions that are acceptable and desirable to all the project stakeholders and in alignment with the OpenXT Project Purpose.</span></p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"> <span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP format</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Participate in the Decision Process, the Voting Process and in Changes to the Board. <span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP perhaps this section should come before or after all the sections it mentions instead of in the middle of said...</span></span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">At least one member of the Governance Board shall be appointed and be required to:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"> Send timely notifications of the upcoming Community Call to the mailing list.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Manage the selection of an alternate date for the Community Call when the regular schedule falls upon a legal holiday.<br/></span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP meeting minutes?</span></span></li></ul><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Decision Process</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Action by the Governance Board will only be invoked in the situation where no resolution to a technical matter can be reached using the process of interaction with the repository maintainers and informal discussions.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Action by the Governance Board is initiated by any member of the community creating an OpenXT JIRA ticket to fully describe the issue that needs resolution. All activity concerning the resolution process will be tracked in the ticket. When a resolution of some form is reached, it will also be entered into the ticket. When the decided upon resolution is enacted, the ticket shall be be closed. This leaves a concrete information trail on exactly what transpired and what the resolution ultimately was.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">&lt;&lt; To be specified: Timetable for action by the Board from the first opening of the JIRA ticket to either i) a concluding resolution or ii) a determination that a Vote will be held. &gt;&gt;</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP another tough time bound rule like the voting an new member above - we may need to figure out a way to address these with some best effort verbiage. If these things do not happen when this document says they MUST happen, then what?</span></span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"> </span>The exact nature of a Board decision resolution may vary widely on a case by case basis. Illustrative examples include: <br/></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The Board decides to request more information regarding a submission or RFC before further consideration.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The Board decides to request an alteration to a submission or RFC before further consideration or as criteria for acceptance.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The Board requests information from an outside expert or agency that can perform an evaluation, provide context and make recommendations to guide decision making.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The Board votes to accept/reject a proposed feature or change in OpenXT. This is a method of resolution of last resort: other approaches should be exhausted before a vote is required.</span></li></ul><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Voting Process<br/></span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">A vote will be required if consensus on the decision resolution is not achieved between members of the Governance Board in the Decision Process.<span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"> Voting can commence when any member of the Governance Board believes it is appropriate</span></span>. Voting shall be required to commence once the maximum time period allowed for the Decision Process has elapsed without achieving consensus on a concluding resolution. The start of the Voting Process must be indicated on the JIRA ticket which will serve as the official record of when the Voting Process began.<br/></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Voting will be done with an indication of <strong>\"yay\"</strong>, <strong>\"nay\"</strong> or <strong>\"abstain\" </strong>by each Board member. Each Board member is granted a single vote. Any member can elect to vote <strong>\"abstain\"</strong> without a requirement to provide a reason. Absent board members who do not provide a vote will be recorded as <strong>\"absent\"</strong>. Voting may not be done by proxy (<span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP that probably needs more detail since it is unclear to me how that works)</span>. The records of all the votes will be recorded in the JIRA ticket.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">When voting is tied due to absent or abstain votes, the non-absent and non-abstaining members of the Governance Board will make a best effort attempt at determining how to proceed.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">The Voting Process is <strong>required to conclude within two weeks</strong> of a vote being called, as determined by the metadata of the JIRA ticket. The Vote is considered final when the maximum time period has elapsed or when all votes have been accounted for, whichever is the earlier. <span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP same comments as above. Maybe we should have a section specifically on what happens when deadlines are not met.</span><br/></span></p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Additional Project Roles<br/></span></h2><h3><span style=\"list-style-type: disc;color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Repository Maintainer, Source Code Committer</span></h3><ul><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Monitors the repositories for Pull Requests and comments and engages with them.</span></li><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Apply the Pull Request Process and perform the actual approval or rejection actions of PRs to the source code repositories.</span></p></li><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Monitor mailing list postings that are relevant to RFCs and Pull Requests.</span></p></li></ul><div><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0);\">RJP I guess we still have some work on defining the RFC (and simple decision) process document.</span></span></div><h3 style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">System Administrators</span></h3><ul><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">JIRA and Confluence<br/></span></li><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Github</span></li><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Google Groups<br/></span></li><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51,102,255);\">&lt;&lt; To do: Add more here and outline role responsibilities of each&gt;&gt;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"> </span></span></li></ul><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Amendments to this Governance Document and Board Structure<br/></span></h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Changes may be made by the following process:</span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Collect and understand the perspectives of affected stakeholders.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Send a written RFC to the OpenXT mailing list.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Discuss the RFC on the monthly OpenXT community call.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Publish revised RFC to the mailing list.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">Finalize and accept the RFC on the next community call.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">If consensus exists on the list/call, one Board member (other than the proposer) records the decision and consensus in a JIRA ticket.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">If no consensus on the list/call, the proposer escalates the decision to the Board via JIRA ticket.
