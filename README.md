# RAGonite: A multi-purpose Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline

> RAGonite is a flexible RAG system built by the NLP team at Fraunhofer IIS (**Contributors**: Chris Hinze, Rishiraj Saha Roy, Joel Schlotthauer, Andreas Foltyn, Luzian Hahn, Farzad Naderi, Viktor Hangya, Darina Gold, Sabrina Stehwien, Viktor Haag, Fabian Kuech). It is a conversational question answering (ConvQA) system that can:
> - operate over heterogeneous data elements like passages, lists, and tables;
> - explain its answers via counterfactual attribution;
> - contextualize evidences in collections using context from the original documents;
> - perform iterative retrieval over a mixture of input sources;
> - automatically induce databases from knowledge graphs (KGs); and
> - run over multiple domains like enterprise wikis, automobile KGs, soccer, and fictional universes.
