# RAGonite: A multi-purpose Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline

RAGonite is a flexible RAG system built by the NLP team at Fraunhofer IIS.
It is a conversational question answering (ConvQA) system that can:
- operate over heterogeneous data elements like documents with passages,
lists, and tables, and RDF knowledge graphs;
- explain its answers via counterfactual attribution;
- contextualize evidences in collections using context from
original documents;
- perform iterative and hybrid (SQL, lexical, dense) retrieval over a
mixture of input sources, with subsequent answer fusion;
- automatically induce databases from knowledge graphs (KGs); and
- run over multiple domains like enterprise wikis, automobile KGs,
soccer, and fictional universes.
